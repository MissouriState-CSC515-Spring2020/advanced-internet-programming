# Project Checkpoint 6

**Due Date: May 1, 2020**

## Overview

Update your application to to code split and dynamically load your JavaScript. Best option is to code split each page/view.

## Requirement
 1. Your project should only load the initial view. As the user navigates to other pages, JavaScript for the other views should load on demand.
    Remember to use the `import()` command to code split.
 2. Ensure your project still meets the PWA requirements after this change.
 
## Turning in the Assignment

 1. Create a git branch for your work.
 2. Commit all applicable files to the branch and push the branch to your repository.
 3. Create a pull request targeting master to turn in the assignment.
 
You must both **push** your branch and **create a pull request** to turn in the assignment.
Both steps are required before the due date to be counted as on-time.
You should review the diff in the pull request and make sure what is included is expected.

The requirements for .gitignore, npm scripts and project setup from previous checkpoints must also be followed.
