# Project Checkpoint 5

**Due Date: April 10, 2020**

## Overview

Update your application to be a YouTube video site (rather than photos). Use the YouTube Data API to pull
data: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3

Many of these endpoints do not require user auth.

## Requirements

 1. Your project should dynamically list video information by calling the YouTube data api on all views.
   You can hard code an initial selector such as a channel id, playlist or search term.
 
## Turning in the Assignment

 1. Create a git branch for your work.
 2. Commit all applicable files to the branch and push the branch to your repository.
 3. Create a pull request targeting master to turn in the assignment.
 
You must both **push** your branch and **create a pull request** to turn in the assignment.
Both steps are required before the due date to be counted as on-time.
You should review the diff in the pull request and make sure what is included is expected.

The requirements for .gitignore, npm scripts and project setup from checkpoint1 must also be followed.
