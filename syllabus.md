**Email:** chadkillingsworth@missouristate.edu  
**Office Hours:** By appointment. I’m generally available by email during business hours.

### Course Description
A continuation of CSC 365. Topics include HTML as a semantic language, advanced css techniques, the DOM event model, asynchronous JavaScript, user input validation, utilizing 3rd party APIs, authentication over HTTP and high performance site design (including request minification and compression). Security principles will be reinforced throughout the course.

**This is not an intro class.**
Students are expected to have a good grasp on basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts.

### Lectures
Lectures will be M-W-F for the first 2 weeks. After that, Fridays will be a lab day
in Cheek 209 unless otherwise announced. See [attendance](#Attendance).

Lectures will be recorded and available on YouTube for later review. However, availability of the recording is not guaranteed. Students are encouraged to attend in person as that affords the opporunity to ask questions during lecture.

Due to my travel schedule, some lectures will be pre-recorded and distributed only as a YouTube video. Students will be expected to watch the video and material in these lectures will be part of tests and assignments.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, students should:

 1. Know and comfortably use git workflow through github.
 2. Understand how to semantically structure an HTML document.
 3. Correctly describe and use CSS techniques such a floating and positioning.
 4. Have an in-depth knowledge of JavaScript  (ES2015 - 2020).
 5. Be familiar with single page application concepts.
 6. Understand HTTP and know how to optimize requests.
 7. Understand and be able to use front-end dependency management and build systems.

### Attendance
Attendance is not recorded or included in course grading. It is to your advantage to attend class, and you are responsible for any information presented, announcements made, or assignments given in class. Late arrival and early departure is discouraged as rude to your fellow computer scientists.

Lab days will be solely for working on assignments. However they are still considered class time.
You should not expect special assistance on homework or projects unless you need additional assistance beyond what is available during labs.

### Grading

Component                  | Percentage
-------------------------- | -------------------
Exams 1 and 2              |            10% each
Project checkpoints        |                 70%
Final Exam                 |                 10%

For the purposes of determining a grade for the course, the grades from exams and projects will be combined as shown above. The course grade will be determined by totaling the score of all exams and assignments and dividing it by the total possible score for the class. Letter grades will be assigned as follows:

 * 90% and above is an A
 * 80% and above is a B
 * 70% and above is a C
 * 60% and above is a D
 * below 60% is an F

The numeric requirements for letter grades may be lowered to reflect a curve but will not be raised.

An “W” grade for this course cannot be assigned after the [deadline](https://www.missouristate.edu/registrar/SP20feepayment-refundschedules.htm).

The project will be divided into a series of checkpoints. A grade for each checkpoint will be given.
Each further checkpoint will build upon the code already submitted so failing to turn in these checkpoints
is not recommended.

### Examinations
Exact dates for exams will be announced in class at least one week in advance. Missed exam(s) may be made up only by prior arrangement or exceptional circumstances.

#### Tentative exam schedule:

  1. February 19
  2. April 1

#### Final Exam

May 11, 3:30 pm

### Important Notes on Grading
The best way to improve your course grade is to submit assignments on time.
The best way to reduce your course grade is to not turn in assignments or attend labs.
The due date will be given with each assignment. The date from when the last commit or when the pull
request is opened (whichever is later) will be used. The time of day will not be a factor.
Late assignments will be penalized 10% for each calendar day after the due date.
All assignments and lab exercises may be completed using MSU-provided equipment and software or software available by download.

### Classroom Policies
#### Laptops, Tablets and Other Devices
Laptop computers, tablets or other devices are allowable for note-taking purposes only, provided that there are only minimal keyboard noises. If I believe that your device is in use for other than note-taking, or is more of a distraction than a benefit to you or to others, I will ask you to put it away. Laptops and PDAs must comply with the cell phone policy in their capability as a “communicative device.”

#### Cell Phones
As a member of the learning community, each student has a responsibility to other students
who are members of the community. When cell phones ring or receive other audible notifications and students respond in class or leave class to respond, it disrupts the class. Therefore, the Office of the Provost prohibits the use by students of cell phones, pagers, PDAs, or similar communication devices during scheduled classes. All such devices must be turned off or put in a silent (vibrate) mode and ordinarily should not be taken out during class. Given the fact that these same communication devices are an integral part of the University’s emergency notification system, an exception to this policy would occur when numerous devices activate simultaneously. When this occurs, students may consult their devices to determine if a university emergency exists. If that is not the case, the devices should be immediately returned to silent mode and put away. Other exceptions to this policy may be granted at the discretion of the instructor.

### University Policies
#### Academic Integrity
Missouri State University is a community of scholars committed to developing educated persons who accept the responsibility to practice personal and academic integrity. You are responsible for knowing and following the university’s student honor code, [Student Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures](http://www.missouristate.edu/policy/Op3_01_AcademicIntegrityStudents.htm) and also available at the Reserves Desk in Meyer Library. Any student participating in any form of academic dishonesty will be subject to sanctions as described in this policy.

#### Nondiscrimination
Missouri State University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action institution, and maintains a grievance procedure available to any person who believes he or she has been discriminated against. At all times, it is your right to address inquiries or concerns about possible discrimination to the Office for Institutional Equity and Compliance, Park Central Office Building, 117 Park Central Square, Suite 111, (417) 836-4252. Other types of concerns (i.e., concerns of an academic nature) should be discussed directly with your instructor and can also be brought to the attention of your instructor’s Department Head. Please visit the OED website at www.missouristate.edu/equity/.

#### Disability Accommodation
To request academic accommodations for a disability, contact the Director of the Disability Resource Center, Plaster Student Union, Suite 405, (417) 836-4192 or (417) 836-6792 (TTY), www.missouristate.edu/disability. Students are required to provide documentation of disability to the Disability Resource Center prior to receiving accommodations. The Disability Resource Center refers some types of accommodation requests to the Learning Diagnostic Clinic, which also provides diagnostic testing for learning and psychological disabilities. For information about testing, contact the Director of the Learning Diagnostic Clinic, (417) 836-4787, http://psychology.missouristate.edu/ldc.
